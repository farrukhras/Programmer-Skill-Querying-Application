# Programmer Skill Querying Application

## Description

In this project, we'll build a programmer skill querying application using MongoDB, Golang, and React. The application allows users to add a new programmer, delete a programmer, and search for programmers based on a certain skill.

The back-end of the application is developed using the Gin framework for Golang. Gin is a web framework that provides a fast HTTP router and essential middleware for building efficient web applications and APIs. It interacts with the MongoDB database to fetch and store data, handling the create, delete, and search operations for programmers.

On the front-end, React.js is used to implement the user interface and the required components. The front-end components communicate with the Golang server to fetch data from MongoDB and display it to the users. The create, delete, and search functionalities are seamlessly integrated into the user interface, providing a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB for data storage
- Golang with Gin framework for back-end development
- React.js for front-end development
